# Bookmetender Integration Guide

## Overview
The XESS system integrates with Bookmetender.com to automatically sync guest data between platforms. This allows venues to manage their guestlists across multiple systems seamlessly.

## How It Works

### 1. Connection Process
1. **Create a Guestlist** in XESS for your event
2. **Connect to Bookmetender** by providing:
   - Your Bookmetender API Key
   - The Event ID from Bookmetender
3. **Enable Sync** to allow automatic data synchronization

### 2. API Integration Workflow
```
XESS Guestlist ‚Üê‚Üí Bookmetender API ‚Üê‚Üí Bookmetender Event
```

### 3. Data Synchronization
- **Manual Sync**: Use the "Sync from Bookmetender" button
- **Automatic Sync**: Configure periodic syncing (coming soon)
- **Bi-directional**: Updates flow both ways between systems
